--------------------------





Coding method one:

    A. Power on the receiver first;
    
    B. Press the receiver [BING] button again;
    
    C. Finally, turn on the transmitter power.

Coding method two:

    A. Both the receiver and transmitter are powered on;
    
    B. Press the receiver [BING] button again;
    
    C. Enter the remote control code matching page to perform code matching.

Power switch: long press to turn on and off, short press to return.


Scroll key: Scroll up and down to select, short press to confirm; 

Scroll key : Stopwatch: (system menu (5) --- > timer (3) --- > state (ON))
press and hold to pause during timing, and press and hold again to clear timing.

Types of buttons


Puss butoon
 It can be momentary (returns to its default state after release) 
Examples:

    Physical Buttons: Like those on keyboards, remote controls, or appliances.
    
    
Toggle Button

The button retains its state until it is toggled again.

Examples:

    On/Off Switch: A common example is a switch that turns a feature or setting on or off.



Three States: (SWB)

On/Off: Most slide switches are used for binary states (e.g., ON and OFF).
In some designs, a slide switch might include an additional middle position, such as ON, OFF, and a third position like a "Neutral" or "Middle" state.

Example of Three-State Slide Switch:

    Position 1: ON
    Position 2: Middle (e.g., a neutral or standby position)
    Position 3: OFF
